The APTx Neuron is a novel computational unit that unifies linear transformation and non-linear activation into a single, expressive formulation. Inspired by the parametric APTx activation function, this neuron architecture removes the strict separation between computation and activation, allowing both to be learned as a cohesive entity. It is designed to enhance representational flexibility while reducing architectural redundancy.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Traditionally, a neuron computes the output as:

$y = \phi\left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b \right)$

where: 
- $x_i$ are the inputs,
- $w_i$ are the weights,
- $b$ is the bias,
- and $\phi$ is an activation function such as ReLU, Swish, or Mish.


The APTx Neuron merges these components into a unified trainable expression as:

$y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ (\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i \right] + \delta$

where:
- $x_i$ is the $i$-th input feature,
- $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, and $\gamma_i$ are trainable parameters for each input,
- $\delta$ is a trainable scalar bias.

#### Experimentation on MNIST
Run the below code to automatically run the APTx Neuron based fully-connected neural network on MNIST and save the `loss` and `accuracy` values in `./result/` directory.

```python
python3 run.py --total_epoch 20
```

#### Conclusion
This work introduced the APTx Neuron, a unified, fully trainable neural unit that integrates linear transformation and non-linear activation into a single expression, extending the APTx activation function. By learning per-input parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$, it removes the need for separate activation layers and enables fine-grained input transformation. APTx Neuron generalizes traditional neurons and activations, offering greater representational power. Our MNIST experiments show that a fully connected APTx-based feedforward neural network achieves 96.69% test accuracy in 20 epochs with approximately 332K parameters, demonstrating rapid convergence and high efficiency. This design lays the groundwork for extending APTx Neurons to CNNs and transformers, paving the way for more compact and adaptive deep learning architectures.
